SAT April 24th - 3:58am: Mari

Did: Fixed homepage a bit, added a title, pictures in the buttons and turned auto-play OFF.
Quiz 2: Implemented data and created drag and drops, implemented a button for submission as well.

To DO: Drag and Drop don't work properly still, we need to decide on how to deal with it,
either JS or backend. I tried both, my assumption is if we go with back end we will need json to update lists, if we go with JS we will need to figure a way to update the dictionary. Will look more into it tom!
