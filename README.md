# ui-volleyball

hey I created a navbar and the basic idea of the homepage. The buttons are not finished yet and I didn't include the video (even though I tried) because it doesn't seem urgent at this point. Also tried to implement a speech bubble but it requires a bit more work so I ended up just altering the borders, not sure if this looks good yet but feel free to edit.

*I guess we both created the next page so I just pasted my changes because I updated the buttons to look like the prototype in both first pages.
*Homepage strategy button now works to redirect to the next page, pictures are displaying and aligned.

- What needs to be done: - Create the "see it in action page" with the gif. - make the see it in action button working. - implement the first learn page.

  -- still need to work on back button ...Ana√Øs
  .

Sat 2:48am - Mari:

- home page now is almost complete, only quiz button is not working.
- video plays in auto play BUT the user has to tap on the volume button for the audio to play (weird, this needs to be fixed before final result but not necessarily in this assignment).
  To do: implement quiz button.

Sat 3:20am - Mari:

- animation plage is complete!
  (Button works, audio works, gif is playing and everything is aligned, BUT...)
  I think we should have a "previous" button here too, not sure... (in this case it wouldn't be complete), we need to discuss.
  Didn't get to work on back button.

Sun 2:57pm - Mari:

*Both home buttons work
*Back buttons were implemented and work (I added one in the third page (action page) because I thought we needed but pending on your opnions)

- "Learning experience" clicking is fully working.
- Challenge yourself button at the end of learning experience is working.

To do:
_ Later on we need to implement some type of focus for when the "back button" is pressed, the page goes down instead of staying centered.
_ Align and fix the design (alignment) of learning pages
\_ It seems there is no feedback for quiz 1, I think assigment says we need at least return a score for the quiz.

--HIIII this is anais

Created quiz 2 html but haven't added anything to the js or from backend.
Question, should we be using the back end at all for the drag and drop since we did everything through js before? I think we might just need the back end for the score for quiz 2 and 3 but I could be wrong.
