TO DOs for Homework 13/Soft turn in

Anaïs: Choose a lighter orange for the title of homepage, move text and video to second page, and mix roles of quiz 2 so that it is challenging for the user. Change the gif to the gif + voice over -> instead of text and audio.

Mari: Design pages between levels - passed level/ also adjusted all quiz pages / final page
(ALL DONE)

Dayna: Fixing feedback of quiz 3 (when the answer is wrong, instead of letting the player go to the next question, provide a “retry” button and only let the user go to the next once the correct answer is chosen.)

Zikora: Score/Total Score: Change the score so that every level only displays the score for that level. In the end, have a final score page that shows the Total score AND information about each level. (Ex: Level 1: 4/6, Level 2: 5/5, Level 3: 6/6 … Total score: 15/17)
