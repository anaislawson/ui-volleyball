# ui-volleyball

hey I created a navbar and the basic idea of the homepage. The buttons are not finished yet and I didn't include the video (even though I tried) because it doesn't seem urgent at this point. Also tried to implement a speech bubble but it requires a bit more work so I ended up just altering the borders, not sure if this looks good yet but feel free to edit.

*I guess we both created the next page so I just pasted my changes because I updated the buttons to look like the prototype in both first pages.
*Homepage strategy button now works to redirect to the next page, pictures are displaying and aligned.

- What needs to be done: - Create the "see it in action page" with the gif. - make the see it in action button working. - implement the first learn page.

- home page now is almost complete, only quiz button is not working.
- video plays in auto play BUT the user has to tap on the volume button for the audio to play (weird, this needs to be fixed before final result but not necessarily in this assignment).
  To do: implement quiz button.
