# ui-volleyball

hey I created a navbar and the basic idea of the homepage. The buttons are not finished yet and I didn't include the video (even though I tried) because it doesn't seem urgent at this point. Also tried to implement a speech bubble but it requires a bit more work so I ended up just altering the borders, not sure if this looks good yet but feel free to edit.
