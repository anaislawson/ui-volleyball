# ui-volleyball

hey I created a navbar and the basic idea of the homepage. The buttons are not finished yet and I didn't include the video (even though I tried) because it doesn't seem urgent at this point. Also tried to implement a speech bubble but it requires a bit more work so I ended up just altering the borders, not sure if this looks good yet but feel free to edit. 


*I guess we both created the next page so I just pasted my changes because I updated the buttons to look like the prototype in both first pages. 
*Homepage strategy button now works to redirect to the next page, pictures are displaying and aligned. 
* What needs to be done: - Create the "see it in action page" with the gif. - make the see it in action button working. - implement the first learn page.
